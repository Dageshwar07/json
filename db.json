              "context": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer programs that can learn and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each serving different purposes. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map input to output based on example input-output pairs. Unsupervised learning aims to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in unlabeled data, while reinforcement learning focuses on training agents to interact with an environment and maximize cumulative rewards through trial and error. Machine learning has diverse applications across various domains, including healthcare, finance, image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.",

Her family had moved to Amsterdam after the Nazis gained power in Germany but were trapped when the Nazi occupation extended into the Netherlands. As persecutions against the Jewish population increased, the family went into hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s office building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed and transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank. Her father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam after the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced that it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in English under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.",
